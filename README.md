This is the home of mayureshkrishna.github.io, a website for my blogs and posts


## Install and Usage

If you'd like to use this repository, clone it. I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Once you've cloned this repo, run these commands in this directory:

```sh
# Only needed the first time:
$ script/bootstrap
# And each time you work locally:
$ script/server
# Below is the expected output:
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

You should then be able to navigate to the server address, and see live edits you make render in your browser. You'll likely have to familiarize yourself with how Jekyll works to do larger edits, but it's worth the effort!
